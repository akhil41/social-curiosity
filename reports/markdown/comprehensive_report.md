## Discussion

### Social Curiosity Effectiveness

The social curiosity mechanism demonstrates varying effectiveness across different implementations. In the tabular setting, the discrete state representation allows for precise tracking of exploration patterns and social bonuses. The deep learning approach, while more flexible, may require additional tuning to effectively leverage social curiosity signals.

### Implementation Trade-offs

- **Tabular Q-Learning:** Offers interpretability and guaranteed convergence but limited scalability
- **Deep RL (PPO):** Provides greater flexibility and potential for complex strategies but requires more computational resources
- **Social Curiosity:** Enhances exploration in cooperative settings but may introduce reward signal noise

## Future Work

### Potential Improvements

1. **Enhanced Social Curiosity Mechanisms**
   - Adaptive bonus scaling based on learning progress
   - Multi-step social credit assignment
   - Individual vs. team-level curiosity rewards

2. **Advanced Architectures**
   - Attention mechanisms for social awareness
   - Graph neural networks for agent relationships
   - Hierarchical reinforcement learning

3. **Extended Evaluation**
   - Larger grid sizes and more complex environments
   - Variable numbers of agents
   - Dynamic task generation

## Conclusion

This study demonstrates the potential of computational social intrinsic motivation to enhance multi-agent reinforcement learning performance. The results highlight the importance of implementation choice and the nuanced effects of social curiosity mechanisms. Future research should focus on developing more sophisticated social awareness models and testing in increasingly complex multi-agent scenarios.
